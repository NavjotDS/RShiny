# RShiny
We have built an application in R Shiny to explore the immigration trend in Canada from various countries across the globe during 1980 to 2013. The main purpose of this application is to identify the top contributing countries to immigration in Canada and study the changes in number of immigrants from these countries during 1980 to 2013.
